## Project Overview

### Title
**Travel Ticket Cancellation Risk Pipeline**

### Description
This project focuses on building a **production-ready ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline** to analyze travel ticket data and predict the likelihood of ticket cancellations. By leveraging the provided dataset, which contains information on ticket purchases, travel patterns, and historical cancellations, our pipeline aims to transform raw data into actionable insights.

### Objectives
1. **Cancellation Prediction**: Develop a reliable model to predict ticket cancellations based on historical and current data.
2. **Data Processing**: Implement an efficient ETL pipeline to process and transform raw data into usable formats.
3. **Risk Management Tools**: Create a visual dashboard or notification system for monitoring cancellation risks in real time.
4. **Insight Generation**: Identify trends and key factors influencing cancellations to support decision-making and improve customer experiences.
